TODO:
* This is something I was using earlier on in the year to abstract the pretty terrible node-cassandra-client interface.
  However the interface for this isn't a lot better if I had more time, I'd have created something chainable or some kind of ORM...
* It might not be in a working state, as I just created the package.json a moment ago and haven't tested the dependencies, etc.
* REFACTOR and check that impossible things aren't made possible by the API (for example, WHERE IN on a non-primary key).
